    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Tiramisu is a traditional Italian sweet dish, made with coffee, sponge,
      egg yolks, mascarpone, and cocoa.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>¼ cup cocoa powder, plus more for dusting</li>
      <li>
        1 cup brewed espresso (optional to add a few tablespoons of dark rum)
      </li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extracts</li>
      <li>5 large egg yolks, colds</li>
      <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>16 ounces mascarpone cheese, chilled</li>
      <li>1.75 cups heavy cream, chilled</li>
      <li>28 hard ladyfinger cookies</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk together the cocoa powder, espresso and vanilla in a bowl and set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a mixer or using a hand mixer, beat the egg yolks and sugar until
        pale and thick, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add in the salt, mascarpone cheese and continue to whip until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chilled heavy cream and continue to whip, until light, creamy,
        smooth and can hold a soft peak
      </li>
      <li>
        Dunk each ladyfinger in the espresso mixture to absorb the liquid and
        start to line a 7x11 oval baking dish with the cookies.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top the first layer of cookies with ½ of the whipped mascarpone mixture
        and use the back of a metal spoon to spread it into an even layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dust with cocoa powder. Repeat for another layer and then finish by
        dusting with cocoa powder on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least 2 hours before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>ALL the ingredients for the filling must be cold</li>
      <li>
        Just a quick dunk of a ladyfinger cookie will do - nothing more than 1-2
        seconds!
      </li>
      <li>Make sure you leave time to rest the tiramisu.</li>
    </ol>
