    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pasta alla Vodka is a creamy, tomato-based pasta that is SO delicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s easy to throw together with minimal ingredients—the perfect weeknight
      dinner.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1/4 yellow onion peeled and minced</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves peeled and minced</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>6 ounces tomato paste</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>3 ounces vodka</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 pound pasta of choice</li>
      <li>1/2-3/4 cup pasta water reserved</li>
      <li>2 ounces finely grated Parmesan-Reggiano plus more as garnish</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter straight from the fridge</li>
      <li>Minced Italian parsley as garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large saucepan, set over medium-low heat, add the olive oil. When
        warm, add the minced onion, garlic and a pinch of kosher salt. Cook
        until softened, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the tomato paste, along with the red pepper flakes, and cook it
        until the tomato paste turns a really dark red color, about 3 minutes.
        Add the vodka and let it sizzle and allow the vodka to cook off a bit,
        about 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the heavy cream and mix it until smooth. Turn off the sauce.
        Now, we’re gonna boil the pasta!
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. You want the water as salty as
        the sea. Pour in the pasta and cook it until about 1 minute shy of al
        dente. Reserve about 1 cup of pasta water. Drain the pasta.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn the heat up on the sauce to medium. Pour in 1/2 cup pasta water,
        along with the grated Parmesan-Reggiano and give it a taste. Add salt to
        taste. I added a pinch or two. Pour in the pasta and then add in the
        cold butter. Mix it vigorously for 1 minute, until thick and luscious.
      </li>
      <li>
        Garnish with grated Parmesan-Reggiano and some minced Italian parsley.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <h4>Tips and Tricks</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Time management.</strong> So much of making pasta is about time
        management. I wrote this recipe with that in mind. You make half of the
        sauce AND then boil the pasta. And then you work your way back to the
        sauce. Be sure to prep all of your ingredients beforehand since it goes
        very quickly once you begin.
